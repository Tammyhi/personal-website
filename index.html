        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Tammy, hi! I'm a sophomore majoring in Computer Science who is constantly exploring new skills
          and interests. Right now, I'm focused on learning how to create visually appealing and functional web
          experiences with a focus on user experience and attention to detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I'm usually reading a book from my never-ending
          to-read list or nerding out over indie horror games.
